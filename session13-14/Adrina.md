Chat transcript (July 6, 2:11 PM): "Hi, I ordered a standing fan (Order #78945) on July 1st. It was supposed to come on July 3. Still no delivery. I paid for next-day delivery. Can someone tell me what’s going on?"

Follow-up Email 1 (July 9, 10:32 AM): "Still waiting. I called your helpline, was kept on hold for 26 mins and then cut off. No one got back to me. This is not acceptable. I’ve paid ₹340 for express and now it’s the 9th. My entire week’s schedule is ruined."

Follow-up Chat (July 11, 6:05 PM): "Your agent yesterday told me the fan had been shipped. Today I got a message saying it was delivered at 2 PM. NOTHING was delivered. I was home all day. No call, no knock. This is fake delivery."

Email escalation (July 13, 8:15 AM): "Now I’m told the delivery guy left it with ‘security.’ I live in an independent house. There IS no security! You’re just making excuses. Worst customer service I’ve ever seen. Tired of explaining again and again."

Final Email (July 16, 4:52 PM): "The fan finally arrived — box looks like it was in a warzone. Fan makes weird noises and stops after 2 minutes. I give up. Return it and refund EVERYTHING. I’m done. Absolutely ridiculous process. I’m never ordering again."]
Subject: Urgent: Resolution for Escalation Ticket #452017 - S. Ramesh (Order #78945)

Dear Mr. Ramesh,

Please accept our sincerest and unreserved apologies for the utterly unacceptable experience you have endured with your recent order (Order #78945). We deeply regret the significant distress, inconvenience, and wasted time this situation has caused you.

We understand that you initially faced a severe delay in receiving your standing fan, despite paying for express delivery. This was compounded by a complete breakdown in our communication, including extended hold times and dropped calls, leaving you without answers. The subsequent false delivery claim, followed by an inexplicable and incorrect assertion about "security" at your independent residence, further eroded your trust. Finally, after an extended wait, the product arrived severely damaged and entirely non-functional.

We recognize your immense frustration, the feeling of distrust due to misleading information, and the profound disappointment with both our service and the product itself. No customer should ever have to go through such a challenging and repetitive process, and for this, we are truly sorry.

Here is a summary of the incidents you experienced:

Date	Incident	Status/Impact
July 6	Delayed delivery	Paid for express, delivery missed (expected July 3)
July 9	Poor communication	26 min hold, call cut off, no resolution
July 11	False delivery claim	Message stated "delivered," but no product received
July 13	Incorrect information	Agent claimed delivery to "security" at independent house
July 16	Damaged/Defective product	Fan arrived in damaged box, non-functional (stops after 2 min)
To rectify this situation and restore your faith in our service, we propose the following multi-step resolution plan:

Full Refund: We will process a full refund for your standing fan (Order #78945) and the express delivery charges (₹340) immediately. This refund should reflect in your account within 3-5 business days.
Product Collection: We will arrange for a special pickup of the damaged fan from your residence at your earliest convenience, at no cost to you. Please let us know your preferred date and time.
Additional Compensation: As a gesture of our apology for the significant inconvenience and wasted time, we would like to offer you a credit voucher of ₹500 for your next purchase with us.
Internal Review: We are initiating an urgent internal investigation into the multiple service failures highlighted in your case to prevent such occurrences in the future.
We genuinely value your business and are committed to making things right.

Sincerely,
