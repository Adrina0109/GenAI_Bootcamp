Chat transcript (July 6, 2:11 PM): "Hi, I ordered a standing fan (Order #78945) on July 1st. It was supposed to come on July 3. Still no delivery. I paid for next-day delivery. Can someone tell me what’s going on?"
Follow-up Email 1 (July 9, 10:32 AM): "Still waiting. I called your helpline, was kept on hold for 26 mins and then cut off. No one got back to me. This is not acceptable. I’ve paid ₹340 for express and now it’s the 9th. My entire week’s schedule is ruined."
Follow-up Chat (July 11, 6:05 PM): "Your agent yesterday told me the fan had been shipped. Today I got a message saying it was delivered at 2 PM. NOTHING was delivered. I was home all day. No call, no knock. This is fake delivery."
Email escalation (July 13, 8:15 AM): "Now I’m told the delivery guy left it with ‘security.’ I live in an independent house. There IS no security! You’re just making excuses. Worst customer service I’ve ever seen. Tired of explaining again and again."
Final Email (July 16, 4:52 PM): "The fan finally arrived — box looks like it was in a warzone. Fan makes weird noises and stops after 2 minutes. I give up. Return it and refund EVERYTHING. I’m done. Absolutely ridiculous process. I’m never ordering again."]
Subject: Regarding Your Escalated Inquiry - Ticket #452017 (Order #78945)

Dear Mr. Ramesh,

Please accept our sincerest apologies for the completely unacceptable experience you have had with your recent order (Order #78945) and the subsequent handling of your inquiries. We deeply regret the immense frustration, inconvenience, and profound disappointment you have endured.

We have thoroughly reviewed your interactions with our team regarding Ticket #452017 and understand that you faced a series of significant challenges. These include a substantial delay in the delivery of your standing fan, repeated failures in communication, an unsubstantiated false delivery claim, and ultimately, the receipt of a damaged and non-functional product.

We recognize how incredibly frustrating it must be to not only experience such extensive delays and a breach of our express delivery commitment, but also to be met with conflicting information, a false delivery claim, and a complete lack of resolution. Your valuable time was wasted, your schedule severely disrupted, and the repeated need to explain your situation without satisfactory outcomes has understandably led to profound distrust and disappointment. We are truly sorry that our service fell so far short of your expectations and our own high standards.

Comprehensive Internal Review: We are initiating an urgent and thorough internal investigation into the series of failures, including the communication breakdowns, the unsubstantiated delivery claim, and the poor handling of your product.
