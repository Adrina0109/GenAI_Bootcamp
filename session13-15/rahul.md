# Subject: Urgent: Resolution for Escalation Ticket #452017 — S. Ramesh (Order #78945)

Dear Mr. Ramesh,

Please accept our sincere and unreserved apology for the distress and inconvenience you experienced with Order **#78945**. We understand that a paid express delivery not arriving, followed by misleading updates and a damaged product, is unacceptable. We are truly sorry.

### Summary of incidents

| Date     | Incident                     | Notes |
|----------|------------------------------|-------|
| July 6   | Delivery delay               | Express delivery expected July 3; not received. |
| July 9   | Poor communication           | 26-minute hold, call cut off, no callback. |
| July 11  | False delivery claim         | System showed "delivered" though no delivery occurred. |
| July 13  | Incorrect delivery note      | Claimed “left with security” at an independent house. |
| July 16  | Damaged / defective product  | Box damaged; fan noisy and stops after ~2 minutes. |

We fully acknowledge your frustration, the erosion of trust caused by contradictory updates, and the disappointment of receiving a damaged item after repeated effort to resolve the issue. This is not the standard of service we aim to provide.

### Resolution plan (steps we will take)

1. **Immediate full refund** — We will process a full refund for the product and the ₹340 express charge. Expect refund to post within **3–5 business days**.  
2. **Pickup of defective item** — We will arrange a complimentary pickup at your convenience within 24–48 hours. Please provide a preferred time.  
3. **Quality and logistics review** — The returned item will undergo QA inspection; we will audit the packaging and carrier handling.  
4. **Investigation of tracking & agent actions** — We will investigate the false “delivered” status and incorrect security note and take corrective action.  
5. **Service recovery** — As a gesture of goodwill, we will issue a ₹500 voucher and a direct follow-up call to ensure closure.

Once again, I regret the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. Please contact me directly for any further assistance.

Warm regards,
