Chat transcript (July 6, 2:11 PM): "Hi, I ordered a standing fan (Order #78945) on July 1st. It was supposed to come on July 3. Still no delivery. I paid for next-day delivery. Can someone tell me what‚Äôs going on?"
Follow-up Email 1 (July 9, 10:32 AM): "Still waiting. I called your helpline, was kept on hold for 26 mins and then cut off. No one got back to me. This is not acceptable. I‚Äôve paid ‚Çπ340 for express and now it‚Äôs the 9th. My entire week‚Äôs schedule is ruined."
Follow-up Chat (July 11, 6:05 PM): "Your agent yesterday told me the fan had been shipped. Today I got a message saying it was delivered at 2 PM. NOTHING was delivered. I was home all day. No call, no knock. This is fake delivery."
Email escalation (July 13, 8:15 AM): "Now I‚Äôm told the delivery guy left it with ‚Äòsecurity.‚Äô I live in an independent house. There IS no security! You‚Äôre just making excuses. Worst customer service I‚Äôve ever seen. Tired of explaining again and again."
Final Email (July 16, 4:52 PM): "The fan finally arrived ‚Äî box looks like it was in a warzone. Fan makes weird noises and stops after 2 minutes. I give up. Return it and refund EVERYTHING. I‚Äôm done. Absolutely ridiculous process. I‚Äôm never ordering again."] Subject: Urgent: Resolution for Escalation Ticket #452017 - S. Ramesh (Order #78945)

Dear Mr. Ramesh,

Please accept our sincere and unreserved apology for the distress and inconvenience you experienced with Order **#78945**. We understand that a paid express delivery not arriving, followed by misleading updates and a damaged product, is unacceptable. We are truly sorry.
