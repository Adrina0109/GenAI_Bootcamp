## SkillBridge: Name, Tagline & Core Features

### The Name: SkillBridge

The name "SkillBridge" is already excellent! It perfectly encapsulates the idea of connecting one's current state to a future, more skilled state, and literally "bridging" gaps in knowledge or ability.

### Taglines

Here are a few options, playing on different angles:

1.  **SkillBridge: Map Your Skills, Master Your Future.** (Concise, action-oriented, and outcome-focused)
2.  **SkillBridge: Your AI Guide to Personalized Learning and Growth.** (Highlights AI and the core benefit)
3.  **SkillBridge: Bridging Your Potential to Professional Achievement.** (Emphasizes the "bridge" metaphor and career context)
4.  **SkillBridge: Unlock Your Potential, Chart Your Path.** (Empowering and clear)

**Recommendation:** I lean towards **"SkillBridge: Map Your Skills, Master Your Future."** It's punchy, memorable, and clearly states the value proposition.
